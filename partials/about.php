                I am a passionate and hands-on developer with experience in building full-stack web applications and 
                integrating hardware-based systems. I’ve developed an Employee Portal using PHP and MySQL for managing 
                leave applications, integrating features like email notifications with PHPMailer, role-based dashboards, 
                and leave credit handling logic.
                </p>

                Beyond the web, I’ve also worked on an IoT-based project involving an ESP8266 NodeMCU and RFID-RC522 module, 
                where RFID tag data is captured and transmitted to a Windows application I developed using C#. 
                My Arduino programming skills bridge the gap between physical hardware and digital applications, creating smooth 
                real-time communication between systems.

                    Currently, I'm focused on developing enterprise-level employee portals and management systems that 
                    streamline business operations and improve workflow efficiency.
